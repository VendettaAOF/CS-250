User needs are based on client feedback. Each requirement laid out by the client gets broken down into individual tasks that each member of the team can accomplish within a day or two. These user stories are a sort of translation of client requirements in a tight and neatly organized manner to make instructions for the development team clear and concise. 
When working on my own projects I tend to tackle each piece of the project individually. Writing my own stories to be accomplished. Once I find myself working with more people on larger projects, agile tools and events that facilitate more open communication will most likely be added to my toolbox.
Great software team members are also excellent communicators. This is a complex industry, and people can let their pride and ego get the better of them. Asking for help can go a long way in plugging knowledge gaps in the team. As well as being there for assistance. Building great software should be a team sport, not an individualistic cage match.
